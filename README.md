Talking Picture Frame powered by pi pico.  

See the youtube explanation For how to wire up the pi pico to an amp/speaker and button.

Record memorable phrases from kids/grandkids etc. as mp3's. Mix them using the mixing code and music files to get pretty mp3's with music surrounding the words.

Load the pico with circuit python. Copy the code.py into your picos code.py file, then copy all mixed mp3's onto the pico filesystem. Voila, press the button and a phrase will play on your 3 in speaker.
